            Inuyasha is a fudal fery tale which did not gain as much popularity as Nruto, but I personally loved the anime. In this anime, 
            the protagonist is a half demon born to a human and a demon. In this anime, you will find cool action, halorious comedy, 
            hart warming emotions and romance. This is a must watch anime for all the youth in the world.
